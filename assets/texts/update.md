# Elementary v1.4.0-alpha.0

Hi again!

As promised in the previous release, this version adds support for LaTeX math formulas. If you're not familiar with LaTeX, Elementary now includes a guide on how to use it (open the command palette with `ctrl+shift+p` and search for "Math"). It covers the basics of writing inline and block equations, as well as some useful commands.

Besides that, the command palette now shows the selected setting from a setting's options.

The plan for the next release is rather bold: a spellchecker. Itâ€™s a complex feature and will definitely take some time. Until then, happy writing!

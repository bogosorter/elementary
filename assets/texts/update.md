# Elementary v1.5.0-alpha.0

Hi there!

Shortly after releasing Elementary, I defined three goals for its future: a preview mode, PDF export support and spellchecking. This release, which I've been long waiting for, is all about spellchecking, and finally completes that list.

The default dictionary is `en_US`. To add more, see the instructions on the spellchecking guide (use the command palette or right-click on any word to get there). This release is somewhat experimental. I’d love to hear how it’s working for you - especially if something goes wrong :)

For the next releases my plan is to polish the app. There's still a lot to do...

Happy writing!

# Elementary

Elementary is a simple markdown editor built by [bogosorter](https://bogosorter.github.io).

## Getting started

If you're in a hurry, start typing right away: Elementary is fairly intuitive.

For more info on the markdown elements and Elementary shortcuts, check the command palette using the settings icon to your left or `ctrl+p`. If you'd like to know a little more about how Elementary came to be, read on!

## Background

I loved Typora's editing experience, but it has since become a paid app... On the lookout for an alternative, I used Marktext - an open-source app - for a while, but it proved itself to be somewhat buggy. After many more frustrated attempts, I turned to VS Code. Though not aesthetically pleasing, VS Code was reliable and met my needs.

Then, I learnt that VS Code's core editor, Monaco, was open-source. That's when the idea of adapting Monaco to fit my needs came to be. The core of Elementary is based on Monaco and should provide a reliable and bug-free experience. I did, however, change all of the editor's styles for aesthetics's sake, and built the logic that makes this a standalone app. Elementary uses electron and react, put together by electron-react-boilerplate.

I hope you enjoy Elementary!

P.S.: Those quotes took a really long time to implement, you should check them out!

P.P.S.: If you got this far, you deserve a treat. I am a huge fan of clean interfaces and, since you're using Elementary, I'm guessing you are too. You can use the command palette to set the interface complexity to Minimal, as I do. Beware: you mustn't forget the shortcut to open the command palette since that's where the app's logic resides.

## Acknowledgements

I must thank [comma](https://github.com/useyourcommas) for her precious help. She reviewed almost every detail in the app, patiently heard my chatter about it and designed Elementary's logo. Elementary would be a different app without her.

Samej Spenser also deserves a special thank you. It's wonderful to have people from the other side of the globe willing to provide such a structured and thoughtful advice.

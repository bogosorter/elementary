# Elementary v1.1.0

Hi there! Since Elementary was first released, just about a month ago, I've received a lot of feedback from you. It is really great to feel the community's support for this little project of mine :D

The main change in this release is the implementation of a preview mode. You can toggle it using the eye icon on the sidebar or the new `ctrl+e` shortcut. Here are some other improvements:

- New sidebar for markdown elements (can be hidden in the settings)
- Support for strikethrough and highlight (highlight isn't supported in preview mode yet)
- New shortcuts for bold (`ctrl+b`), italic (`ctrl+i`) and links (`ctrl+k`)
- Word and character count information
- Optional line numbers - activate on settings
- Optional highlight of current line - activate on settings
- Markdown is now rendered inside quotes. Quotes got more robust overall.
- Bug fixes, of course! Especially a bug that made selecting text difficult, caused by the hacky quote implementation I had in place.

What's coming up in the future? An alpha version with an integrated PDF exporter will be released in the next few days. There are also plans for a spellchecker, though that will require some time. Other new features will depend, quite literally, on you! Most of the changes in this version came from suggestions made by users, and I'd love to hear from you.

Happy writing!

## Acknowledgements

Samej Spenser deserves a special thank you. It's wonderful to have people from the other side of the globe willing to provide such a structured and thoughtful advice.

I'd also like to thank all of the other people who asked for new features in Elementary. I've felt, in previous projects of mine, a barrier of communication between me and the project's users. Elementary has so far been different. Please, keep it up!

# Elementary v1.2.0



Hi again!

The main highlight of this release is the new PDF exporter. To export a file, use the button on the sidebar or the command palette. For configuration details, open the command palette and search for "PDF Export Guide." Here’s what else has changed:

- New shortcuts for uppercase (`ctrl+u`), lowercase (`ctrl+l`) and duplicate lines (`ctrl+d`)
- Improved file identification in "Open Recent"
- Added an error message when opening a recent file that no longer exists
- Shortened path display for the current file on small screens
- New setting to receive notifications about future pre-releases

What’s coming next? I’m planning to add a spellchecker, though it may take some time. Other new features will depend, quite literally, on you! Most of the changes in this version came from suggestions made by users, and I'd love to hear from you.

Happy writing!

## Acknowledgements

Samej Spenser deserves a special thank you. It's wonderful to have people from the other side of the globe willing to provide such a structured and thoughtful advice.

I'd also like to thank all of the other people who asked for new features in Elementary. I've felt, in previous projects of mine, a barrier of communication between me and the project's users. Elementary has so far been different. Please, keep it up!

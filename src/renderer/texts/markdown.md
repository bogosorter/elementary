# Markdown syntax

Elementary supports all standard markdown elements. Here's a quick refresher:

- **Bold** text is surrounded with two `*` or two `_`
- *Italic* text is surrounded with one `*` or one `_`
- List items start with a single `-`
- Quotes start with a `>`
- Inline code is surrounded with a backtick
- Links are formated like [this](https://example.com)
- Headings use a variable number of hashtags: `##` is a level two heading and `###` is a level 3 heading.

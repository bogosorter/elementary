`# Elementary

Elementary is a simple markdown editor built by [bogosorter](https://bogosorter.github.io).



## Getting started

If you're in a hurry, start typing right away: Elementary is fairly intuitive.

For more info on the markdown elements and Elementary shortcuts, check the command palette using the settings icon to your left or \`ctrl+p\`. If you'd like to know a little more about how Elementary came to be, read on!



## Background

I loved Typora's editing experience, but it has since become a paid app... On the lookout for an alternative, I used Marktext - an open-source app - for a while, but it proved itself to be somewhat buggy. After many more frustrated attempts, I turned to VS Code. Though not aesthetically pleasing, VS Code was reliable and met my needs.

Then, I learnt that VS Code's core editor, Monaco, was open-source. That's when the idea of adapting Monaco to fit my needs came to be. The core of Elementary is based on Monaco and should provide a reliable and bug-free experience. I did, however, change all of the editor's styles for aesthetic's sake, and built the logic that makes this a standalone app. Elementary uses electron and react, put together by the electron-react-boilerplate.

I hope you enjoy Elementary!

P.S.: Those quotes took a really long time to implement, you should check them out!

P.P.S.: If you got this far, you deserve a treat. I am a huge fan of clean interfaces and, since you're using Elementary, I'm guessing you are too. You can use the command palette to set the interface complexity to Minimal, as I do. Beware: you mustn't forget the shortcut to open the command palette since that's where the app's logic resides.



## Acknowledgements

I must thank [comma](https://github.com/useyourcommas) for her precious help. She reviewed almost every detail in the app, patiently heard my chatter about it and designed Elementary's logo. Elementary would be a different app without her.

Samej Spenser also deserves a special thank you. It's wonderful to have people from the other side of the globe willing to provide such a structured and thoughtful advice.

export const markdown =
`# Markdown syntax

Elementary supports all standard markdown elements. Here's a quick refresher:

- **Bold** text is surrounded with two \`*\` or two \`_\`
- *Italic* text is surrounded with one \`*\` or one \`_\`
- List items start with a single \`-\`
- ~~Strikethrough~~ text is surrounded with two \`~\`
- ==Highlighted== text is surrounded with two \`=\`
- Quotes start with a \`>\`
- Inline code is surrounded with a backtick
- Links are formated like [this](https://example.com)
- Headings use a variable number of hashtags: \`##\` is a level two heading and \`###\` is a level 3 heading.

For further syntax elements check [this guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/).

export const changelog =
`# Elementary v1.2.0-alpha.1

Hi again!

The main highlight of this release is the new PDF exporter. To export a file, use the button on the sidebar or the command palette. For configuration details, open the command palette and search for "PDF Export Guide." Hereâ€™s what else has changed:

- New shortcuts for uppercase (\`ctrl+u\`), lowercase (\`ctrl+l\`) and duplicate lines (\`ctrl+d\`)
- Improved file identification in "Open Recent"
- Added an error message when opening a recent file that no longer exists
- Shortened path display for the current file on small screens
- New setting to receive notifications about future pre-releases

What's coming next? I'm planning to add a spellchecker, though it may take some time. Other new features will depend, quite literally, on you! Most of the changes in this version came from suggestions made by users, and I'd love to hear from you.

Happy writing!

Samej Spenser deserves a special thank you. It's wonderful to have people from the other side of the globe willing to provide such a structured and thoughtful advice.

I'd also like to thank all of the other people who asked for new features in Elementary. I've felt, in previous projects of mine, a barrier of communication between me and the project's users. Elementary has so far been different. Please, keep it up!



## Get in touch

I'd love to hear from you. These are a few useful links:

- [Open an issue](https://github.com/bogosorter/elementary/issues) on GitHub or send an email to \`luiswbarbosa@gmail.com\`.
- Elementary's [source code](https://github.com/bogosorter/elementary) might also be useful.

## Export configuration

Please note that Elementary's PDF exporter will work out of the box. All of the steps described here are optional. PDF configuration is done through some metadata at the top of the document in [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML).

To start a YAML block, insert this at the top of your document:

\`\`\`markdown
---
# Content goes here
---
\`\`\`


### Document title

\`\`\`yaml
---
document_title: The Complete History of Bogosort
---
\`\`\`

### PDF options

You may change the output file's dimensions, margins, and orientation.

\`\`\`yaml
pdf_options:
  landscape: true
  format: A6
  margin:
    top: 10mm # px, mm, cm and in are all alowed
    bottom: 10mm
    left: 10mm
    right: 10mm
\`\`\`

### Custom header and footer

You can customize a header and a footer for your exported pdf using html. Some special variables are provided: \`date\`, \`title\`, \`pageNumber\`, and \`totalPages\`. To use the \`pageNumber\`, for instance, you should have an element with the classname \`pageNumber\`. This might be a bit confusing - take a look at the examples:

\`\`\`yaml
---
pdf_options:
  displayHeaderFooter: true
  headerTemplate: "
    <p style='font-size: 14px; text-align: center; width: 100%; font-weight: bold'>
      <span class='title'></span>
    </p>
  "
  footerTemplate: "
    <p style='font-size: 10px; text-align: center; width: 100%'>
      <span class='pageNumber'></span>/<span class='totalPages'></span>
    </p>
  "
---
\`\`\`

## Including CSS

Markdown's simplicity is quite useful for text editing, but it becomes somewhat limited when you want to apply custom styles to your document. That's why markdown supports inline html and allows you to include CSS styles.

You can embed CSS either into the initial metadata or into the body of your markdown file. Please note, though, that CSS included into the body will be rendered in both preview mode and the exported PDF, whereas CSS included in the YAML section will only be rendered in the exported PDF.

Including CSS files in the YAML:

\`\`\`yaml
stylesheet:
  - /home/bogosorter/styles.css
  - etc.
\`\`\`

You can link to a CSS file in the body of your document:

\`\`\`html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="./path/to/file.css">
\`\`\`

Alternatively, you can include inline CSS like this:

\`\`\`html
<style>
    p {
        font-style: italic;
    }
</style>
\`\`\`


## Additional tips

**Page Breaks**

Content will sometimes break in odd places when it is exported. To prevent this, you can use some inline HTML to force a break in a more convenient place:

\`\`\`html
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
\`\`\`

**Generated HTML**

The conversion from markdown into PDF is done in two steps:

1. Conversion from markdown into HTML
2. Conversion from HTML into a PDF

The intermediate conversion into HTML is done using [Marked](https://marked.js.org/). You might find their [demo page](https://marked.js.org/demo/) a useful tool to inspect the generated HTML. This comes in handy, for instance, to know what CSS selectors you should use.



## Export errors

If Elementary reports an error while exporting, please check your export configuration carefully - that's where most errors come from. If the error persists please [file an issue](https://github.com/bogosorter/elementary/issues).
